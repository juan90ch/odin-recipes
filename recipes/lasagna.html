    <p>
        Lasagna is a comforting and hearty Italian dish made up of layers of wide pasta sheets, rich meat or vegetable sauce, creamy béchamel sauce (or ricotta), and plenty of melted cheese. It’s a crowd-pleasing favorite, often served at family gatherings and special occasions. The layers meld together beautifully, with the perfect balance of savory meat, creamy cheese, and tender pasta. It's a dish that becomes even more flavorful after a day or two, making leftovers just as delicious!

    <h2>Process:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the Meat Sauce (Ragù):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, garlic, carrot, and celery, and sauté until softened (about 5-7 minutes).
                </li>
                <li> Add the ground meat and cook, breaking it up with a spoon until browned (about 8 minutes).
                </li>
                <li> Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1-2 minutes to deepen the flavor.
                </li>
                <li> Pour in the red wine (if using) and let it simmer for 2-3 minutes, allowing the alcohol to evaporate.
                </li>
                <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, stock (or water), oregano, basil, sugar, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat and cook for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens and the flavors meld.</li>
                </li>
            </ul>
                
        <li>Make the Bechamel Sauce</li>
         <ul>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in the flour and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, to form a roux (a thickening base).
            </li>
            <li>Slowly add the milk while whisking to avoid lumps. Keep whisking until the sauce thickens and comes to a simmer (about 5 minutes).
            </li>
            <li>Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg (if using). Once thickened to a creamy consistency, remove from heat and set aside.
            </li>
            </ul>

        <li>Prepare the Lasagna Noodles</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you're using regular lasagna noodles, cook them according to the package instructions, drain, and lay them flat on a sheet of parchment paper to prevent sticking.
                </li>
                <li>If using no-boil lasagna noodles, you can skip this step as they will cook in the sauce during baking.
                </li>
            </ul>
        
        <li> Asamble the Lasagna</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>

                <li>In a baking dish (about 9x13 inches), spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom.
                </li>
                <li>  Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.
                </li>
                <li> Spread a layer of béchamel sauce over the noodles, followed by a generous layer of meat sauce.
                </li>
                <li>Sprinkle a little grated mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the meat sauce.
                </li>
                <li>Repeat the layers (noodles, béchamel, meat sauce, cheese) until all ingredients are used, finishing with a top layer of meat sauce and a generous amount of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>Bake the Lasagna</li>
            <ul>
                <li> Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil (to prevent the cheese from burning) and bake for 25-30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, until the top is golden and bubbling.
                </li>
                <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before serving. This will help it set and make slicing easier.
                </li>
            </ul>

    </ol>

        <p>
