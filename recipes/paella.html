                A seafood paella is a flavorful and vibrant Spanish dish, traditionally hailing from the region of Valencia. It features a beautiful medley of fresh seafood, aromatic rice, and bold seasonings. The dish is typically made with short-grain rice, which absorbs the rich flavors of the broth, giving it a satisfying texture. The seafood includes a variety of fresh options, such as shrimp, mussels, clams, squid, and sometimes fish fillets.

                The base of the dish is usually made with onions, garlic, bell peppers, and tomatoes, sautéed in olive oil. Saffron, a signature ingredient, gives the dish its signature golden hue and a delicate floral flavor. The rice is cooked in a seafood stock, which deepens the overall taste. The paella is often finished with a squeeze of fresh lemon, adding a burst of acidity to balance the richness of the seafood and rice.

                It’s often served in the wide, shallow pan in which it’s cooked, with the seafood arranged beautifully on top for an impressive presentation. The crispy, caramelized rice at the bottom, known as socarrat, is considered a delicacy by paella lovers.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
        <li>Prepare the seafood: Clean and prep all seafood (shrimp, mussels, clams, squid, and fish). Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Cook the vegetables: Heat olive oil in a large paella pan or wide skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, bell peppers, and garlic, and sauté until softened (about 5 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes and spices: Stir in the diced tomatoes, saffron (with its soaking water), smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 5 minutes, until the tomatoes break down and form a sauce.
        </li>
        <li>Add the rice: Stir in the rice and cook for 2 minutes to coat the rice with the tomato mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Add the liquids: Pour in the white wine (if using), and allow it to cook off for 1-2 minutes. Then, add the seafood stock and water, and bring to a simmer. Adjust the heat to medium-low. Let the rice cook uncovered for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add the seafood: Arrange the seafood (shrimp, mussels, clams, squid, and fish) on top of the rice. Press down gently so the seafood is partly submerged in the liquid.
        </li>
       <li> Cook until the rice is done: Continue cooking for 10-12 minutes, until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid and is tender. Avoid stirring too much, as paella should develop a crispy layer of rice at the bottom (socarrat). If needed, add a little more water or broth during cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Let it rest: Once the rice is cooked and the seafood is done, remove from heat and let the paella rest for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Serve: Garnish with chopped fresh parsley and lemon wedges. Serve warm and enjoy!
        </li>
