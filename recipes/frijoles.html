    <h2>Ingredients for 4px</h2>

    <h3>for the meat</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300g (10 oz) ground beef (for carne molida or ground beef stew)
        </li>
        <li>4 chorizo sausages (Colombian-style, or any mild pork sausage)
        </li>
        <li>4 slices of pork belly or 200g (7 oz) pork ribs
        </li>
        <li>4 small pieces of beef steak (about 150g or 5 oz each)
        </li>
        <li>4 fried eggs (one for each serving)
        </li>
    
    </ul>
    <h3> For the sides</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of red beans (or black beans, cooked and seasoned)
        </li>
        <li>2 cups of white rice (cooked)
        </li>
        <li>4 small fried plantains (tostones or maduros, depending on preference)
        </li>
        <li>1 avocado (sliced)
        </li>
        <li>1 lime (cut into wedges)
        </li>
        <li>1 small bunch of fresh cilantro (optional, for garnish)
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Beans:</li>
        <ul>
       <li>If you're using dried beans, soak them overnight and then cook in a large pot with water, salt, and a couple of garlic cloves until soft (about 1-1.5 hours). Alternatively, canned beans can be used—just heat them up with some onion, garlic, and a bit of salt to enhance their flavor.
       </li> 
    </ul>
        <li>Cook the Rice:</li>
        <ul>

        
        <li>Cook the rice according to your preferred method (typically 1 part rice to 2 parts water), adding a pinch of salt. Once cooked, keep it warm for serving.
    </li>
    </ul>
       <li>Cook the Meats:</li>
       <ul>

       <li> Beef Steak: Season the beef steaks with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Heat a bit of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat and cook the steaks to your desired level of doneness (about 4-5 minutes per side for medium).
       </li>
        <li>Ground Beef: In a separate pan, cook the ground beef with a little oil over medium heat. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic, and cook until browned and fully cooked (about 8-10 minutes).
       </li>
        <li>Pork Belly/Ribs: Fry the pork belly in a hot pan with a bit of oil until crispy and golden. Alternatively, if using pork ribs, grill or pan-fry them for about 6-8 minutes on each side until they’re well-cooked and crispy on the outside.
       </li>
        <li>Chorizo: Grill or pan-fry the chorizo sausages until browned and cooked through (about 10 minutes). Cut into slices for easy serving.
        </li>
    </ul>
       <li>Prepare the Fried Plantains:</li>
       <ul>

        <li>For tostones (savory fried plantains), peel and slice green plantains into thick rounds. Fry them in hot oil until golden, then remove and flatten them using a flat tool or the bottom of a cup. Return them to the oil and fry again until crispy and golden. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with a pinch of salt.
        </li>
        <li>For maduros (sweet fried plantains), peel and slice ripe plantains diagonally. Fry in hot oil until golden brown and caramelized (about 2-3 minutes per side).
       </li>
    </ul>

        <li> Fry the Eggs:</li>
<ul>
        <li>In a separate skillet, fry one egg per person to your preferred level of doneness (typically sunny side up or over-easy).
       </li>
    </ul>

        <li> Assemble the Bandeja Paisa:</li> <ul>

       <li> On each large plate, begin by adding a generous portion of white rice and a scoop of beans.
        </li>
        <li>Arrange the cooked meats: place a piece of steak, a spoonful of ground beef, a slice of chorizo, and some crispy pork belly or ribs on the plate.
       </li>
        <li>Add the fried plantains (either tostones or maduros, depending on your preference).
        </li>
        <li>Place a fried egg on top of the rice or beside the meats.
       </li>
        <li>Garnish with slices of avocado, a few lime wedges for squeezing, and a sprinkle of fresh cilantro (optional).
        </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
